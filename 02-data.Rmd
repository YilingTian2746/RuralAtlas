# Data sources

With the widespread of rural population, we need to find dataset which can indicate the socioeconomic factors we are interested in across different rural regions, and Ivy encounters this awesome dataset ----Atlas of Rural and Small-town America, which comes from the collaboration work of USDA agencies and ERS research team. This dataset provides us broad categories of socioeconomic factors rural counties across the nation and demonstrates them in different csv files, including People.csv, Jobs.csv, County classifications.csv, Income.csv, Veterans.csv, and a complementary csv file describing variables used in the dataset. The following discussion will illustrate a little bit more about each csv file.\

The raw data has 3278 rows and groups by states; however, the first row shows overall information of each variable for the United States, and the first row of each group contains information of each variable for that particular state; therefore we are actually using data for 3225 rural counties.\

People.csv is a demographic data from the American Community Survey, including information about total population rate change, international migration, migration, immigration, education, population density, age composition, race and ethnicity composition, and family composition across all states. Most variables are numerical, except for the State and County columns.\

Job.csv is an Economic data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and other resources, including information about unemployment rate, labor force, occupational composition. Most entries are counts and percentages information of each variable which are all numerical, except for the State and County columns.
Income.csv is an Economic data from the U.S Census Bureauâ€™s Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates (SAIPE), including information about Poverty rate for all age, poverty for age under 18, Deep poverty, median household income, per capita income. Also, Most entries are counts and percentages information of each variable which are all numerical, except for the State and County columns.\

Veterans.csv are indicators from the American Community Survey on social and economic conditions of veterans; however, we decided not include this file in our dataset, since we focus on more general socioeconomic status, not just for a particular group.\

County classifications.csv contains information about several categorical variables, such as Rural-urban continuum, population loss, manufacturing-dependent counties, economic dependence and other ERS county codes, where 0 means the county is not in that category, and 1 means the county is in that category. Some of variables are binary indicating whether each state is a specific group, some of them are categorical showing which level a county is in of that variable.\

### Possible issues
This dataset contains a significant amount of social and economic variables of 3278 rural counties across all the states; however, a considerable large number of variables only have data on a specific year, which would be difficult for us to capture the changes. Moreover, the data of some variables are before 2005, which may be less valuable for us to dig in. Hence, we may use average of more recent years data to do casual and geographic data, and those data on specific years can be used for time series analysis.\
