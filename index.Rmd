# Introduction

Rural area residents whose population is 14 percent of the U.S residents (based on results from July 2017) spreads across 72 percent of Nation’s land area, but do we know enough about Rural areas other than this fact? What kind of image comes to mind when thinking of a rural place? Does it include the farmhouse down the road? Does it include communities stand at the crossroads? Does it include housing division next to a farmed land? The answers to the previous questions might be ‘Yes’, but to better understood the social and economic status of the rural areas, we need more answers.

Over the past century, the United States has experienced a significant urban growth. With the expansion of urban areas and urban population, the rural population growth rate has declined over the decades. In 2010, the U.S rural population growth rate has reversed for the first time. In 2016-2017, the rural population increased by 0.1 percentage and this rather modest increases continues; however, the U.S population in rural counties stood at 46.1 million in July 2019, which essentially stay unchanged from 46.2 million in 2010. Without a doubt, the stability in the rural population growth rate does not indicate all the socioeconomic indicators stay unchanged across all the rural areas. Therefore, in this project, we are trying to discuss some aspects of the rural areas through geographic, time series, race and ethnicity analysis.
More specifically, we are trying to describe socioeconomic status variation among different parts of the U.S rural areas; meanwhile, different population composition based on race and ethnicity; and unemployment rate changes from 2015 to 2019 across different regions of the U.S rural areas.
