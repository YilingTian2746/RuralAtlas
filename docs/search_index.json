What kind of image comes to mind when thinking of a rural place? Does it include the farmhouse down the road? Does it include communities stand at the crossroads? Does it include housing division next to a farmed land? The answers to the previous questions might be ‘Yes’, but to better understood the social and economic status of the rural areas and small towns in the US, we need more analyses. Over the past century, the US has experienced a significant urban growth. With the expansion of urban areas and urban population, the rural population growth rate has declined over the decades. In 2010, the US rural population growth rate has reversed for the first time. In 2016-2017, the rural population increased by 0.1 percentage and this rather modest increases continues. However, the US population in rural counties stood at 46.1 million in July 2019, which essentially stay unchanged from 46.2 million in 2010. Without a doubt, the stability in the small town population growth rate does not indicate all the socioeconomic indicators stay unchanged across all the counties. Therefore, in this project, we are trying to discuss some interesting social aspects of the US counties through geographic, time series and dependency relationship analysis. specifically, we are trying to describe the socioeconomic status variation among different parts of the US rural areas; meanwhile, different population composition based on race and ethnicity; and unemployment rate changes from 2015 to 2019 across different regions of the US rural areas. 1.1 Reference: Info about rural population proportion and living space spread: https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/rural-economy-population/population-migration.aspx Info about rural population changes from 2010 to 2019: https://www.ers.usda.gov/amber-waves/2019/february/rural-population-trends/ "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources With the constant economic development and drastic urban growth of the US, it is intriguing to find datasets that could help us identify socioeconomic changes and factors that affect these changes across different states and counties in the US. Ivy encountered this comprehensive dataset —- Atlas of Rural and Small-town America, which was aggregated by USDA agencies and the ERS research team(data set link:https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/atlas-of-rural-and-small-town-america/download-the-data/). This dataset provides us with a broad range of socioeconomic factors across the nation, which are classified based on the general categories. These datasets include People.csv, Jobs.csv, County classifications.csv, Income.csv, Veterans.csv, with a complementary file explaining the variables used in each of the dataset. The following paragraphs describes what each of the dataset contains in a little more detail . The raw data has 3278 rows grouped by states, where each row represents a county. One important thing to notice is that the first row of the whole dataset is the data about US overall, and the first row of each state shows the overall information of each variable for the United States, and the first row of each group contains information of each variable for that particular state; therefore, the data is actually describing information of 3225 rural counties. People.csv contains demographic data from the American Community Survey, including information about the total population rate change, international migration, migration, immigration, education, population density, age composition, race and ethnicity composition, and family composition across all states and counties. Most variables are numerical, except for the State and County columns. Job.csv contains Economic data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and other resources, including information about unemployment rate, labor force, occupational composition. Most entries are counts and percentages information of each variable which are all numerical, except for the State and County columns. Income.csv contains Economic data from the U.S Census Bureau’s Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates (SAIPE), including information about Poverty rate for all age, poverty for age under 18, Deep poverty, median household income and per capita income. Also, Most entries are counts and percentages information of each variable which are all numerical, except for the State and County columns. Veterans.csv contains data that represents indicators from the American Community Survey on social and economic conditions of veterans; however, we decided not include this dataset for our analyses, since we would like to focus on more general socioeconomic status variables for this project such as income rates and unemployment rates. County classifications.csv contains information about several categorical variables, such as Rural-urban continuum, population loss, manufacturing-dependent counties, economic dependence and other ERS county codes. Some of these variables are binary, where 1 means the county is in that category and 0 means otherwise. Others are categorical variables showing which level a county is in for that variable. 2.0.1 Possible issues A significant number of social and economic variables of 3225 rural counties are included in these dataset; in addition, a considerable large number of variables only have data on a specific year. Thus, it could be difficult for our team to accurately capture all the information and patterns. Moreover, some data dates before 2005, which may be less valuable for us to dig in. Hence, we might select a subset of variables that are more relevant and comprehensive to work with. For example, we may use the average of the more recent years of some variables to analyze dependancy andspatial relationships, and use the data on a range of different years for time series analysis. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation Our raw data contains 5 .csv files each describing one aspect of the socioeconomic status for all counties in the United States. Since the raw data are already stored in .csv format with proper column names, they can be directly loaded into R data frames. The first step was to import all the data except for the veterans.csv. This is because general socioeconomic attributes such as unemployment rate and per capita income are more relevant to the questions we are trying to answer, so we will not be focusing on veteran data. After the importing step, we selected a subset of variables from the People and County Classification dataset, and kept all the variables for the Jobs and Income dataset. Specifically, the variables selected from the People dataset are the rates of different education levels, and the variables selected from the County Classification dataset describe poverty, natural amenity and low education classifications. These attributes are highly related to our topic, and all other not so applicable variables are discarded. We noticed that the columns in the data frames already have proper data type; hence we didn’t make modifications on that. However we plan to convert the FIPs variable into a factor during future analysis and graphing. For the last step, we joined the cleaned data into one data frame using the FIPs since FIPs is like an ID and is unique for each county. This new data frame was exported to a csv file under the folder data/cleaned; it will be used for the analyses in the rest of this report. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Missing pattern plots", " Chapter 4 Missing values To identify the patterns of missing values, the following plots are useful. For both of the plots below, the x-axis contains the US states and the y-axis contains some socioeconomic variables, and the fill color represents the percentage of counties within a state that has missing values for the socioeconomic variable. The objective of this project is to analyze socioeconomic status of all US counties; however, there are too many counties (3225 in total) to identify missing value patterns for each of them. Therefore, we decided to identify missing patterns for each state. Since each state might have a different percentage/number of counties with missing values, the fill color shows the percentage of missing values for a specific state and socioeconomic variable. 4.1 Missing pattern plots 4.1.1 Missing value pattern by state and three special binary variables Based on the plot below, we conclude that most of the states do not have missing values; on the contrary, PR(Puerto Rico), AK(Alaska) and HI(Hawaii) have a significant number of missing values. This could be due to the fact that PR, HI and AK are far from the other states of the US; in addition, PR and HI are islands with very remote counties. Therefore, it could be hard to collect comprehensive data in these states, which results in the missing data. CO(Colorado), IL(Illinois) and VA(Virgina) also have a very small percentage of missing values (&lt; 2%) for no obvious reasons. 4.1.2 Missing value pattern by state and the rest of the variables A similar pattern exists in the second plot: most of the states do not have any missing values. The states that have the most number of missing values match the ones observed from the first plot, including HI, AK, PR. While VA and NM(New Mexico) also have a small percentage of missing values. 4.2 Why separate the variables into two plots? Note that the data is grouped by states, and the first row of each state group is the records for the state itself (not any county within the state). While examining the cleaned data, we noticed that three variables are special: HiPov, HiAmenity and Low_Education_2015_update. For the first row of every state group, these three variables are all missing values. This makes sense since they are binary variables describing characteristics of each county, and it should not have any value for the rows describing the overall state statistics. Therefore, for the first plot only, we removed the first row of each state group when plotting the missing value percentages. Hence, the socioeconomic variables are separated into two sets: the three variables mentioned above and the other variables, based on which the two plots are created. 4.3 Additional justifications for the choice of plots We did not plot the missing patterns with the data values since fill color already shows the percentage of counties with missing value for each state, and it could be confusing to have parts of the graph with fill representing the data values and other parts with fill being missing percentages. The choice of having states on the x-axis and variables on the y-axis is for visualization purposes. Due to the large number of socioeconomic variables, the graph is better presented to have them on the y-axis. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Geographical analysis 5.2 Dependency Relationship analysis 5.3 Time series analysis 5.4 Summary", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Geographical analysis This part of the results aims to analyze how some of the important socioeconomic status varies across all the counties in the US. To perform these analyses, we used a dataset called counties from the “urbnmapr” package, which contains geographical information of each county (e.g longitude and latitude). The maps do not contain PR(Puerto Rico) since the geographic information of PR is missing from the counties dataset. This does not significantly affect the overall analysis as our data for PR has a lot of missing values to start with. In addition, for all the graphs in this section, missing values are filled in red. Note that some data is missing but cannot be indicated on the graphs because the geographical data for these counties is missing as well (e.g the Prince of Wales-Outer Ketchikan and Skagway-Hoonah-Angoon county in AK(Alaska)). Lastly, note that the color scale for each graph is different. For instance, poverty rate graph has a scale of 0-60%, while the unemployment rate graph has a scale of 0-24%. 5.1.1 Unemployment rate This demonstrate how the unemployment rate varies by different counties and states respectively. Instead of using the number of unemployed people within each county, unemployment rate is used to avoid confusion since overall population varies significantly between states. The same rationale applies to some of graphs below too. According to these maps, the general trend is that the states in the mid-US and above TX(Texas) tend to have lower unemployment rate, while counties with highest unemployment rate are in AK, AL(Alabama), CA(California) and AZ(Arizona). One thing to notice is that the exact unemployment rate does depend on the specific county. For example, the state average for SD(South Dakota) is very low, yet three of the counties have relatively high unemployment rate (above 12%). Moreover, some county-level data in AK is missing as discussed in Missing Data. 5.1.2 Education rate In this section, “high education” refers to a 4-year college or an associate’s degree. For similar reasons as discussed above, the rate of high education is used instead of the total number of people with high education. An important thing to note is that the data only accounts for adults 25 years old and over. Since it is possible and common to attain a college or associate’s degree before the age of 25, we should keep in mind that the data is not comprehensive. The trend of high education is not as obvious as the unemployment rate; however, we can see that the states in the northern US has more counties with high percentages of people with high education when compared to the southern US. No county has more than 90% of people with high education, and the highest education rate exist in WA(Washington), MT(Montana), WY(Wyoming) and CO(Colorado). 5.1.3 Poverty rate For similar reasons as discussed above, the poverty rate data is used instead of the total number of people in poverty. Based on this graph, the general pattern is that more counties in the southern US states have relatively high poverty rate than the northern counties; again, poverty rate varies between counties with each state. For instance, although SD(South Dakota) seems to have low poverty rate in general, some of its counties have more than 50% poverty rate. This observation is somewhat consistent with the high education trend since it makes sense that counties with more people obtaining high education tend to have less poverty issues. 5.1.4 Per capita income It is not very obvious as which part of the US has higher per capita income; however, if looking closely, it seems that the south-eastern counties in general and some of the western counties have lower per capita income. This pattern is very similar to that of the high education graph, which suggests that there might be a dependency relationship between education level and average income. It is also interesting to notice that for most of the states, there is one or more counties with a singificantly higher average income than the other counties. We can also see that one of the counties (Rio Arriba) in New Mexico is missing per capita income data. 5.2 Dependency Relationship analysis 5.2.1 Dependency relation between Unemployment Rate and Education levels. We are using this plot to illustrate the dependency relationship between unemployment rate and education level of each state. In order to present a more general trend, we decide to use data of each state, not individual county. Variables Used: Ed1LessThanHSPct: indicating the the percentage of adults 25 and over with no high school diploma or GEM, from 2014 to 2018. Ed2HSDiplomaOnlyPct: indicating the the percentage of adults 25 and over with a high school diploma or GED only, from 2014 to 2018. Ed3SomeCollegePct: indicating the percentage of adults 25 and over with some college experience, from 2014 to 2018. Ed4AssocDegreePct: indicating the the percentage of adults 25 and over with associate’s degree, from 2014 to 2018. ED5CollegePlusPct: indicating the percentage of adults 25 and over with a 4-year college degree or more, from 2014 to 2018. meanvlue The education level data is averaging from 2014 to 2018, so we decide to average the Unemployment rate from 2014 to 2018 and store this variable as meanvalue. Each state has six corresponding data points, the purple ones represent the average unemployment rate from 2014 to 2018, and the remaining ones represent education levels, differentiated by colors. Note: the average unemployment rate are arranging in a descending order; meaning state at the top has higher unemployment rate than state at the bottom. From the plot, we can see a relatively significant positive relationship between unemployment and Ed1LessThanHSPct, which means, as the rate of adults with no high school diploma increases, the unemployment rate is likely to increase; moreover, we can also see a relatively significant negative relationship between unemployment and Ed4AssocDegreePct, which means as the rate of adults with associate’s degree increases, the unemployment rate is likely to decrease.The other levels of education seem to have a relatively weak dependency relation with unemployment rate. To verify the dependency relation discussed above, we need to do further regression analysis. 5.2.2 Dependency relation between Unemployment Rate and Occupation Insdustries We are using this plot to indicate possible dependency relation between unemployment rate and occupation percentage in the labor force of each state. In order to present a more general trend, we decide to use data of each state, not individual county. PctEmpAgriculture,PctEmpMining,PctEmpConstruction,PctEmpManufacturing,PctEmpTrade,PctEmpTrans,PctEmpInformation, PctEmpFIRE,PctEmpServices,PctEmpGovt represents the percentage of the civilian labor force 16 and over employment in Agriculture, Mining, Construction, Manufacturing, Wholesale and Retail Trade, Transportation,Information services, Finance and Insurance and Real Estate and rental, Services, Public Administration respectively. meanvlue The education level data is averaging from 2014 to 2018, so we decide to average the Unemployment rate from 2014 to 2018 and store this variable as meanvalue. For research simplicity, we decide to take only four occupational industries. According to our first plot, which indicates the percentage of every occupational industry of each state, PctEmpServices, PctEmpConstruction, PctEmpTrade, PctEmpManufacturing are the ones with the relative high percentage; therefore, we decide to take these four industries and check for dependency relation with unemployment rate. According the our second plot,we can see a relatively significant positive relationship between unemployment rate and PctEmpServices, which means, as the percentage of civilian labor force 16 and over employment in Service increases, the unemployment rate is likely to increase. Meanwhile, we also can see a relatively significant negative relationship between unemployment rate and PctEmpManufacturing, which means, as the percentage of civilian labor force 16 and over employment in Manufacturing increases, the unemployment rate is likely to decrease. Similarly for PctEmpConstruction, and PctEmpTrade; as the percentage of civilian labor force 16 and over employment in Construction increases, the unemployment rate is likely to decrease; as the percentage of civilian labor force 16 and over employment in Wholesale and Retail Trade increases, the unemployment rate is likely to decrease; however the dependency relation between PctEmpConstruction,PctEmpTrade and unemployment rate seems to be relatively weak. To verify the dependency relation discussed above, we need to do further regression analysis. 5.2.3 Dependency relation between Unemployment Rate and Poverty Rate We are using this plot to verify if there is a correlation between unemployment rate and poverty rate in 2018. Variables used: UnempRate2018: Unemployment rate, 2018. PovertyAllAgesPct: Poverty rate, 2018. Each state has two corresponding data points, the blues ones represent unemployment rate, and the red ones represent poverty rate. Note: the blue ones are arranging in a descending order; meaning state at the top has higher unemployment rate than state at the bottom. According to the plot, each state has a higher poverty rate than the unemployment rate. Holding unemployment rate in a descending order, the spread of poverty rate seems to be random; hence, there is no visible correlation between poverty rate and unemployment rate. 5.2.4 Dependency relation between poverty and natural amenities scale It is quite counterintuitive to find no relationship between poverty rate and unemployment rate. Hence, we would like to explore about what factors may have some relationship with poverty rate. By exploring the data we find a variable called Hiamenity which indicates whether the natural amenities scale of a county is high or not. The natural amenities scale is a measurement on the environmental qualities of a county. A county with a high natural amenities scale means the environmental qualities in that area is pleasant. Intuitive, people will prefer to live in a county with natural amenities scale. With this assumption, the populations in natural amenities scale would increase gradually. Then these population increases may finally benefit the local economy. Therefore, we would expected relatively more poverty counties also have low natural amenities scale. In order to explore the relationship between the poverty and natural amenities scale of counties, we used mosaic plot. According to the mosaic plot above, the proportion of high poverty counties are very close between high natural amenities scale counties and other counties, which means that there are no strong relationship between poverty and natural amenities scale of a county. Then we introduced another factor which indicates whether a county is low education county or not. After comparing the proportion of low education counties in each group, we find that a low education county are also more likely be a high poverty county. 5.2.5 Dependency relation between poverty rate and college degree rate Then we further investigated the relationship between education and poverty rate. We defined the low education rate to be the percent of adults over 25 who have no high school diploma. And then we compare the low education rate and poverty rate of each state. According to those bar charts, the low education rate is generally close to the poverty rate of that state. In most northeast states, these two percentages are very close to each other. These findings confirmed the relationship between poverty rate and education. 5.3 Time series analysis This graph shows the trends of unemployment rate in each state from 2010 to 2019. In this decade, the unemployment rate decreased uniformly in every state of the U.S. Besides the decreeing in the percentage itself, the variance of the unemployment rate also decreased quite a lot. In 2010, the unemployment rates in Nevada and California is above 15% and the unemployment rate in Nebraska is only about 5%. Their differences are around 10%. But in 2019, the unemployment rates of different states are very similar. They are all around 3%. Although there are some small fluctuation on the unemployment rate in some central states, the unemployment rates decreased quite smoothly. In general the unemployment rate of most states reached its lowest point in 2019. But we can also notice that in Hawaii and some central states such as Iowa, Mississippi, Wisconsin, the unemployment rate increased in 2019. 5.4 Summary Both of the poverty rate and unemployment rate are highly correlated with geographical factors. In particular, states in the mid-US tend to have lower unemployment rates and stats in the northern US tend to have lower poverty rate. The unemployment rate are correlated with the education conditions and industrial structures in that state. And the poverty rate are also correlated with the low education rate. However, a high unemployment rate is not always accompanied by a high poverty rate. Despite the geographical differences, the unemployment rates of all states in the US have dropped a lot over the last decade.

For example, percents of civilian labor force in different occupational industries are all obtained by averaging from 2014 to 2018; similarly for those percentages of persons at different education levels, deep poverty rate, per capita income. Without yearly detailed information of each variable, we have to average the most important socioeconomic factor, Unemployment rate, we’ve discussed in out project. By doing that, we lose a lot of information on how variables, like percentage of education levels, percentage of occupation employed, deep poverty rate, affect unemployment rate on yearly basis. In order to indicate possible trend or correlation among socioeconomic factors, we normally need data from a relative long time frame; however, a considerable large number of variables only have data on a specific year, such as, poverty rate which is another important socioeconomic factor we include in out project. Since it only has data of 2018, when we try to find possible correlation between poverty rate and other variables, we can only demonstrate the general pattern on year of 2018. 7.3 Future directions We could look into seemly outliers or usual trend and try to figure out the reasoning behind it.
