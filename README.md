This project, mainly discusses several socioeconomic factors of counties across the United States. We have chapters to indicate how these socioeconomic factors,such as unemployment rate, education level, per capita income , poverty rate and etc., have been different geographically; moreover, we have chapters to present possible dependency relationships among those factors; and we have chapters to illustrate how these factors have changed over years.
